# Why Glimpse

> There are too many VSCode extensions already. Why create another one?

Hey, I'm [Marco](https://ieni.dev), the author of Glimpse. ðŸ‘‹
I'm glad you asked. ðŸ˜Ž

This story starts in 2018 when I started using [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/),
and I was blown away by the ergonomics and the discoverability of its key bindings.
I decided I wanted the same experience in all the other IDEs I was using.

Today, I maintain [Intellimacs](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/intellimacs), [Spaceclipse](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/spaceclipse), and [VSpaceCode](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode),
the plugins emulating Spacemacs respectively for [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
