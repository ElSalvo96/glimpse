# Why Glimpse

> There are too many VSCode extensions already. Why create another one?

Hey, I'm [Marco](https://ieni.dev), the author of Glimpse. ðŸ‘‹
I'm glad you asked. ðŸ˜Ž

This story begins in 2018 when I started using [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/).
I was blown away by the ergonomics and the discoverability of its key bindings, so
I decided I wanted the same experience in all the other IDEs I was using.

Today, I maintain [Intellimacs](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/intellimacs), [Spaceclipse](https://github.com/MarcoIeni/spaceclipse), and [VSpaceCode],
the plugins emulating Spacemacs respectively in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Everything is great: people love these projects because they are able to switch from spacemacs to other IDEs when needed.
However, I have one issue with these plugin: I don't feel like recommending them to non-Spacemacs users, because
the Spacemacs key bindings make sense only in the context of Spacemacs.

For example, let's compare some of the key bindings of [VSpaceCode] and Glimpse:
- TODO

Speaking of [VSpaceCode]: to emulate as many spacemacs features as possible,
it installs 5 extensions with it.
This is great for spacemacs users: VSpaceCode is a battery-included solution.
However, for non spacemacs users TODO.
