# Configuration

You can make Glimpse your own by configuring its key bindings.

To allow maximum flexibility, Glimpse let you configure its menu by using `javascript`.

To edit the default configuration file, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette and search for `Glimpse: Configure`.

After editing the configuration file, you need to reload the window for the changes to take effect.
To do so, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette and search for `Developer: Reload Window`.
